# ItemLocker
Simple plugin which prevents players from accidentally dropping their items! If an item is locked, it cannot be dropped from the player's inventory until its unlocked.

## Commands
- `/locker lock` - Locks the current item in hand, making it undroppable
- `/locker unlock` - unlocks the current item in hand, returning it back to normal
- **Permission**: itemlocker.use, for both of them.
